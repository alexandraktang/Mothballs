<strong>Mothballs</strong> is a visual novel about navigating the intersection between being Asian-American and LGBTQ+. Our protagonist is a Vietnamese lesbian named Juliet, who is struggling to come to terms with her sexuality, among other things. Through finding some seemingly-insignificant objects, Juliet slowly recalls the memories that have caused her to seek solace in the first place.

I wanted to make a game that was personal to me and that, despite the gravity of the topic, offered some hope and light. I wanted to make a game that I wish I'd had when I was growing up. I hope this game will be that for the people who find themselves in the position I was in then.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> This game was created for my capstone project for Macaulay Honors College, and designed during ARTS 172 (Game Design) at Queens College for my final project.</em>
